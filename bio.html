<h2>Childhood and Education</h2>
	<p>I was born and raised in Lexington, Kentucky, where my family still lives today. 
	   I graduated from Bryan Station High School in June of 2011.</p> 
<h2>Short Biography</h2>
	<p>At Tufts University, I am currently pursuing a degree in Arabic. In addition to this,
	   I hope to pursue a major or minor in computer science. I am also interested in music,
	   and I play the cello in the Tufts Symphony Orchestra. My true passion, however, is
	   education. During the year, I teach an SAT class in the Somerville community and 
	   in the summer of 2012 I taught literature in Manchester, NH. In the future, I hope 
	   to combine my interests by working with English Language Learners and STEM (Science,
	   Technology, Engineering, and Math) education outreach in urban and rural schools. </p>
