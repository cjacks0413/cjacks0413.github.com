Personal portfolio using HTML5 and CSS that has a main page with links to a personal
biography and a resume.

All files in special repository, consistent git commits with messages, no absolute URLs,
pages pass HTML and CSS validators. Two CSS files--one for mobile device (iPhone 4) and 
one for desktop computer. On mobile device font-size differences are less extreme and 
text is fit-to-screen. 

Collaborators: Ming Chow, Trevor John, Sarah McDaniel, Jesse Serrino, Tara Kola: Github and
special repos, relative URIs. 

Hours: 6.5
